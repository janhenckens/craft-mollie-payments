# Mollie Payments for Craft CMS

Mollie Payments gives developers an easy way to accept payments on your website.

The plugin doesn't handle products, taxes or price calculation, giving you the freedom to use it in any way you need to.

A one-off payment for a donation, event registration with online payments or an all out javascript cart implementation, stick this plugin to the end of that flow and accept payments in 1, 2 ,3.

*Note that this plugin is not built, affilated or supported by Mollie and that this plugin does not work with Craft Commerce*
