# Managing subscriptions

## Front-end
To allow users to manage their subscription(s), we need a way to authenticate them. 

### Craft User
If there is a Craft user signed in when the subscription is created, the plugin will save the user's ID with a subscription automatically.

// TODO function to get subscriptions by user?


### By e-mail
On sites that don't user Craft's users, the only way to authenticate a subscriptions owner is through their email address.

That flow works as follows:
- We have a form in which the user supplies their emailaddress
- If we have a customer of the supplied address, we'll send out an email that contains a link on which the user can manage their subscription

To give you control over this experience (both how it looks and how it is worded), you can use the following settings:
<br>

#### Template path for "manage subscription" email  - `manageSubscriptionEmailPath`
Which template the plugin should use for this email. The link to manage the user's subscriptions is available in the ``link`` variable. You also have access to the full `subscription` element, with the custom fields you have set on it. 

#### Subject of the "manage subscription" email - `manageSubscriptionEmailSubject`
The subject for the email

#### Route/URL to the "manage your subscription - `manageSubscriptionRoute`
URL where the page to manage subscriptions is located.


#### Form
````twig
 <form method="post">
    {{ csrfInput() }}
    {{ actionInput('mollie-payments/subscription/get-link-for-customer') }}
    <div>
        <label for="email">{{ "E-mail"|t }}</label>
        <input type="email" required name="email">
    </div>
    <button type="submit">{{ "Find my subscription"|t }}</button 
</form>
````

#### Overview

````twig
{% set uid = craft.app.request.getParam('subscriber') %}
{% set subscriptions = craft.mollie.getSubscriptionbyUid(uid) %}

{% for sub in subscriptions %}
    <div class="my-4">
        {{ sub.interval }} - â‚¬{{ sub.amount }} - {{ sub.email }}<br>
        <a href="{{ actionUrl('mollie-payments/subscription/cancel', {
            'subscription' : sub.id,
            'subscriber': uid
        }) }}">{{ "Cancel subscription"|t }}</a>
        <hr>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
````

## Control panel
Subscriptions can also be managed from the control panel. For active subscriptions, a button to cancel the subscrtiption will be displayed in the sidebar.
